# Diversity Enforcement

Having a Code of Conduct is the first step in providing for a diverse, welcoming, and inclusive environment for everyone.

An example of unintentional exclusion occurs when it comes to *enforcing* your DrupalCamp’s Code of Conduct. When posting your event’s Code of Conduct, be sure to include a point of contact for any infractions.

Participants must have a way to report when they have been made uncomfortable. They must **also** know that there are concrete consequences to negative actions. Clearly communicate what those actions are. Show a willingness to not only promote, but *enforce* diversity, equity, accessibility, and inclusion. Your participants will feel more comfortable at your Drupal event.  

Be overly communicative about your code of conduct. Let attendees know about it in marketing emails. Make them agree to it when they buy tickets. Have slides in your opening session deck that reminds attendees of the code of conduct, as well as who to speak to. Remind them that they should report *anything* that they see, as well as anything they experience. 

Make sure that the people you choose to receive code of conduct reports have been trained to receive them. [Sage Sharp of Otter Technology](https://otter.technology/) does a great training. Also, have more than one person designated to receive reports. Ideally, have people of different genders/backgrounds. This way, attendees will be able to choose the person they feel most comfortable with to speak to should the need arise. 

Encourage speakers to include a slide about the code of conduct and points of contact in their deck.
