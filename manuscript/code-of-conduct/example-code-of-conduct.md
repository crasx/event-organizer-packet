## Code of Conduct

DrupalCamp brings together people from around the world who use, develop, design, and support the Drupal platform. Many attendees at DrupalCamp are newcomers evaluating both our platform and our community.

The Drupal Code of Conduct ([http://drupal.org/dcoc](http://drupal.org/dcoc)) outlines our shared ideals and values. This document expresses how we hope to make these ideals real at our conferences and other events. Our goal is to ensure that all participants can freely and openly share ideas. We want to ensure a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment. We encourage and hope to inspire mutual respect and collaboration.

## Come for the software, stay for the community

Drupal would not exist without its community. We want all attendees at DrupalCamp to have an awesome experience, both in and out of formal conference sessions. The purpose of this document is not to restrict the diversity of ideas and expression in the Drupal Community. Rather, it's to raise awareness of the potential for actions that could exclude current and potential members of the community.

## We are considerate

DrupalCamp is an event that attracts diverse people from a wide variety of ethnic, cultural, and religious backgrounds. We acknowledge that cross-cultural communication is often complicated. We encourage everyone to consider the impact of their actions. Your actions may have a different impact on those with different backgrounds and experiences. We also encourage everyone to consider the honest intentions of those who may have unknowingly caused offense.

## We are welcoming

One of the greatest strengths of the Drupal community is our inclusiveness. Making all attendees feel welcome and included at DrupalCamp is everyone’s job. This includes exhibitors and sponsors.

## We are respectful

All participants should strive to treat all people with dignity and respect. We do not tolerate discrimination on the basis of:
* culture
* religion
* physical appearance, 
* disability
* race
* ethnicity,
 * gender expression
* sexual orientation. 
This includes organizers, sponsors, volunteers, speakers, and attendees. 

## We are collaborative

When misunderstandings occur, we encourage working things out between one another whenever possible. People are encouraged to take responsibility for their words and actions. Listen to constructively-presented criticism with an open mind, courtesy, and respect.

## When we disagree, we consult others

If people are unable to work out issues between themselves, we encourage them to seek advice. Reach out to a mutually trusted third party or a designated community volunteer to help mediate.

You may contact the Drupal Community Working Group to help mediate or resolve issues. Contact  via email at [drupal-cwg@drupal.org](mailto:drupal-cwg@drupal.org) or with an [online incident report](https://www.drupal.org/governance/community-working-group/incident-report).

## When we need it, we ask for help

We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. If you feel threatened or violated as a result of intimidating, harassing, abusive, discriminatory, derogatory or demeaning conduct, immediately notify a staff member. Likewise, please immediately notify a staff member if you notice that someone else is being subjected to such behavior.

The DrupalCamp team wants everyone to feel safe for the duration of the conference. If necessary, conference staff are empowered to take appropriate actions. 
These may include, but are not limited to: 
* Warnings.
* Expulsion from the conference without refund.
* Referrals to venue security or local law enforcement.

## We’re all in this together

Thanks for making DrupalCamp awesome for everyone!
