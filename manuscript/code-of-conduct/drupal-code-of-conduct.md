# Drupal Code of Conduct

The Drupal Code of Conduct ([https://www.drupal.org/dcoc](https://www.drupal.org/dcoc)) defines the shared ideals of the Drupal Community. 

1. [Be considerate.](https://www.drupal.org/dcoc#consideration)

2. [Be respectful.](https://www.drupal.org/dcoc#respect)

3. [Be collaborative.](https://www.drupal.org/dcoc#collaboration)

4. [When we disagree, we consult others.](https://www.drupal.org/dcoc#conflict-resolution)

5. [When we are unsure, we ask for help.](https://www.drupal.org/dcoc#ask-for-help)

6. [Step down considerately.](https://www.drupal.org/dcoc#stepping-down)

The Drupal Code of Conduct is a great start for establishing a solid behavioral standard for the Drupal Community. As event organizers running a Drupal camp or event, take further steps.  *Actively* promote diversity within your campâ€™s Code of Conduct.

Remind everyone why they:
 
**Come for the software, stay for the community.**
