# Event-level Code of Diversity

_This is a working, living, in-progress document. Contributions are encouraged._

We believe that the organizers and the camp itself should understand what it means to make your event diverse and inclusive. 
This is necessary for making your event as diverse and inclusive as possible. 

A diversity statement for a camp is a public declaration of intent and setting of boundaries. This is like your code of conduct for attendees.

This complete statement should include:

* An acknowledgement of the systemic inequalities in the wider technology community.
* A demonstrated understanding that even with good intentions,  biases can make events exclusionary.
* A commitment to examining the effects of diversity and inclusion at every milestone.
* A commitment to making the every aspect of the event as inclusive and diverse as possible.

\[ We should provide a sample statement here \]
